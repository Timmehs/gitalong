# Gitalong

See what your community is up to on Github.  Gitalong aspires to be a convenient way of checking out the latest projects of the users you follow, and even allows you to star repos from Gitalong itself.

### Feed

Your feed will automatically sort the aggregated list of repos by last-pushed.  You can also sort by stars to see the most 'popular' projects.

Filter by:
* languages
* starred/unstarred repos
* include/exclude followers
* include/exclude following

Gitalong can also help you explore the repos of a single user in a convenient, easy to parse way.  Try going to: `/users/Timmehs` for a filterable list of my own projects, for example.
